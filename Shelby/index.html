                  This app reminded me how easy and simple a small act of
                  kindness can go. Recently, my grand-puppy hurt his neck. My
                  daughter took him to the vet, and he was put on 6 medications.
                  The next day he (the dog) seemed to be very stressed out and
                  in a lot of pain. While my daughter was in school, I took my
                  grand-puppy to the vet for second opinion. We adjusted his
                  medications (I paid for a few more) and by the next day he was
                  feeling MUCH better!

                    I always thought it would be awkward to step in and help
                    strangers. What if they didn't want my help? However, this
                    app challenged me to push past my comfort zone and lend a
                    helping hand. I saw an older lady struggle in the grocery
                    store to reach her food item off the top shelf. Nervous she
                    would reject my help, I offered anyway. She ended up
                    thanking me profusely and I was able to make her day a
                    little bit easier.

                  I told my mom I couldn't wait to be a grown up so I could help
                  make a difference in the world. She told me I didnt need to be
                  a grown up, and I could do things now as a kid! So when I
                  heard my baby sister Ruby cry, I brought her binky to her, and
                  helped put it in her mouth. She spit it out with a big smile
                  and mommy was so proud of me.

                  When I want to make someone smile, I go to my contact list,
                  and randomly scroll through it and whoever it lands on I call
                  them just to check in. It helps me stay connected with my
                  community, and lets other's know I am thinking about them.
