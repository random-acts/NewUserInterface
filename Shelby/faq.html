        <h3>How do I skip past a random act that I don't want to do?</h3>
        <p>
          For right now, you would just go ahead and click the "generate" button
          again. This will refresh the generator and provide you a new random
          act of kindness. We are working on having a "skip" button in future
          versions so it will not come back to you.

      <div class="list">
        <h3>Can I enter my own acts of kindness?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! We encourage everyone to add random acts of kindness into our
          generator! If there is something special you enjoy doing for others,
          please add it!

        <h3>What are the benefits of doing an act of kindness?</h3>
        <p>
          Not only will it brighten your day and make you feel good about
          yourself, but it will help someone else in the community.

        <h3>Is there a way to use the Random Acts Generator without logging in?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the only way to operate the generator is to log in.

      <div class="list">
        <h3>Do the acts of kindness cost money?</h3>
        <p>
          Some of them can cost money and some of them are free. If you get an
          act of kindness that costs outside of your budget, you can just
          click the generate button and obtain a new one!

      <div class="list">
        <h3>
          Is there a point system in place for each act of Kindness that we do?</h3>
        <p>
          We do not reward acts of kindness with prizes or reward points. We
          belive everyone should give back to the community out of the love in
          their hearts.

        <h3>
          How do I report my acts of kindness?</h3>

          If you would like to share your act of kindness, please feel free to
          <a href="#">contact us!</a>

        <h3>
          What if I don’t finish the act of kindness I signed up for, do I get
          penalized?</h3>
        <p>
          There is no pentalty for not finishing your act of kindness. All we
          ask of you is that you do your best.

          Is there a t-shirt, badge, or hat we get in the mail for signing up, I
          don’t want the police being called on me for trying to help someone
          cross the street?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we do not provide any type of uniform. It is best
          practice to ask the person if they would like for you to do your act
          of kindness with them (helping them cross the street).
