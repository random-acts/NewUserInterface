                <p class="fontsize"> You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them
                    happen. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We'll lay all these little
                    funky little things in there. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just
                    running through the woods here. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than
                    kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
