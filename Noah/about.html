                        <p class="colorwhite fontsize edit-p">The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. </p>

                    <p class="fontsize"> All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. <p>

                    <h3> About Our Program </h2> 
                    <p class="fontsize"> You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
